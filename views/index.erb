      <p class="summary">Imagine yourself and a posse of like-minded ruby hackers on a country retreat with zero internet for a weekend of fun. You'll laugh, hack, learn, cry (well, you probably won&#8217;t cry&#8230; but you know&#8230; it felt poetic) and most likely play a crap-load of Werewolf.</p>

      <ol id="events">
        <li><a href="#au_may_2017">Australia, Mount Bundy Station (Darwin), May 2017</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="placeholder">Rails Camps are becoming regular fixtures in countries like Australia, UK, USA, Denmark and Poland. It would be awesome to see more happen elsewhere. Rails Camps happen because people make them happen. People like you.</p>

      <h2>Rails Camp Runs</h2>
      <p>Often Rails Camps have charity runs as part of their event - <a href="http://railsrunners.org">Railsrunners</a> is built for this very purpose.</p>
